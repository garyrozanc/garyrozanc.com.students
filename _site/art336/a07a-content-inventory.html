    		<p>As I previously mentioned there are a lot of initial steps that happen simultaneously when starting a web project. However, I think if there was one clear starting point, it would be with the content. Before you can start the visual design—different from art direction—you need to know what you’re designing. Before user research can really get into full swing, user’s need content to interact with to be observed. Finally, you need content before you can organize the content into sections, pages, etc.</p>

<p>However, not every project is a simple redesign with existing content. Startups start from scratch. Even redesigns could be creating new content. So, depending on the needs of the client, this phase/step will look very different.</p>

<h2 id="bmoresponsive">Bmoresponsive</h2>
<p>You will use this <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/umbc.edu/spreadsheets/d/1POid-yXrlX6X1DrcoLfvNSVcejCvG_IwnR-KfNSLA4E/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" title="Content Inventory">Google Sheet</a> as a template to conduct a site inventory of <a href="https://devopsdays.org/events/2020-baltimore/welcome/">devopsdays Baltimore</a>. Do not work in this document, rather copy it and create your own and upload a pdf at the end of class. Be sure to include your team members name in the final inventory. Your site inventory will contain the following information that we will cover during class.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Navigation Title:</strong> The name of the main navigation link to the content (e.g. the link title in the main navigation).</li>
  <li><strong>Page Title:</strong> The displayed page title.</li>
  <li><strong>URL:</strong> Display the URL.</li>
  <li><strong>Content Type:</strong> Is this a basic page, publication, news story, article, technique, FAQ, or something else?</li>
  <li><strong>Content Description:</strong> A brief, basic description that serves as a reminder about what’s on the page.</li>
  <li><strong>Media &amp; Downloads:</strong> List of all media on each page including: image, video and audio files.</li>
  <li><strong>Links:</strong> List of links into and out of each page.</li>
  <li><strong>Comments:</strong> Notes and things for you to remember. Consider listing things you liked or disliked about the page.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If you received <strong>8–10 points</strong> your team correctly identified the major pages and content of those pages.</li>
  <li>If you received <strong>5–7 points</strong> your team mostly identified the major pages and content of those pages.</li>
  <li>If you received <strong>0–4 points</strong> your team only identified a few of the major pages and content of those pages.</li>
