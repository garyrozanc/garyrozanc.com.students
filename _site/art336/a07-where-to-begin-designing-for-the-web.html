    		<p>It takes a team to design, develop and launch a successful website. Very few people have all the varying skillsets to do everything necessary to create a website from content strategy through back-end development. However, no matter what part of the website you are working on, you need to know about the others. Developers and User Experience Designers need to know about visual design, and how what they do will impact the design. This is also true for graphic designers. Designers need to know about content strategy, back-end/front-end development, user experience, and information architecture. Without knowledge of how all these professions come together to create an app or website, designers can’t work as effectively as those who do.</p>

<p>Now, while everyone who works on a website should know all that goes into creating a website, they don’t have to be experts on every part of it. I have no idea what the exact ideal balance of all these skills are to make the most employable graphic designer, so don’t ask. However, I do have strong recommendations on the <em>minimal balance</em>. During the next few in-class exercises my goal is to give you the minimal understanding of these different phases of the web design process so you can fully leverage them to make the best design possible.</p>

<p>Now, what makes the first step in the process confusing for me as an instructor—and for emerging designers when they start working in the field—is there are four or more phases/steps happening at once! Making it even more difficult to replicate in class, information from each of these phases/steps, while happening simultaneously, are relayed to each team as they happen. For example, the content strategists are working with the information architects (IA), and the user experience (UX) team is bouncing back and forth between design and IA. Even development (DEV) might be involved at this point in discussions with IA and UX.</p>

<p>To do my best to replicate this, I’ve decided to introduce four of these phases/steps in a single class so you know how they are all related. Once introduced, you will have multiple class periods to work on them. The order is not imporatant, since they are happening simultaneously.</p>
