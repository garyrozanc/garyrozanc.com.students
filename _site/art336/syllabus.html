</ul>

<h2 id="policy-on-classroom-expectations">Policy on Classroom Expectations</h2>

<h3 id="communications">Communications</h3>
<p>One learning objective of this course, “Make use of an interactive design process,” goes beyond creating visuals. The interactive design process involves working in multidisciplinary teams. Those multidisciplinary teams consisting of content strategists, designers, developers, user experience designers, etc. work in concert and communicate constantly. Currently, <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> is the tool most commonly used for teams to collaborate. Therefore, we are going to use Slack for all class communications. If you are having trouble using Slack, setup a time to meet with me one on one. It’s pretty straightforward, so it won’t be much of a learning curve.</p>

<p>You will need to make sure that you can see each of the following channels: #announcements, #articles, #class-assignments, #comments-questions, #screencasts. If you don’t see one of these channels direct message me and I will add you.</p>

<p>One bonus to using Slack is all the different groups you can join. Since designers use Slack daily, they have also setup groups to discuss design, jobs, freelance, etc. If you find a group not on these two lists, post it on our Slack group.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://getflywheel.com/layout/best-slack-groups-for-designers/">Best Slack Groups for Designers</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://slacklist.info/">Slack List</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="workload">Workload</h3>
<p>5 classes is considered a typical course load <em>15 credits a semester × 8 semesters = 120 credits</em>. Each class is 4 contact hours <em>4 hours × 5 classes = 20 hours</em>. Each class also has 4 hours of outside work each week <em>20 classroom hours + 20 outside work hours = 40 hrs)</em>. I will assign projects and readings each week to fit within that formula. If you can’t commit to a minimum of 4 hours of outside work each week you won’t do well in this course.</p>

<p>Finally, read the class blog carefully before asking questions. 99.9% of your questions have already been answered and are on the blog, including your grades, my office hours and contact info! If you email me a question that is already on the blog I’ll remind you to read the blog.</p>

<h3 id="attendance">Attendance</h3>
<p>You get two personal days to use for illness, campus sanctioned activities, personal reasons, etc. No documentation is necessary, these are your personal days to utilize as you deem necessary. On subsequent absences, your final semester grade is lowered by 10% (one letter grade) for each absence. For example, if you have a “B” and missed four classes you will receive a final grade of a “D”. Absences are automatically factored into your final grade in the class dashboard.</p>

<p>Attendance will be taken within the first 10 minutes of class. Students who show up after attendance is taken are already marked absent. Being late disrupts the flow of class for the students who are on time if I have to stop everything to update your attendance from absent to late. To avoid disrupting the class to change your <em>Absent</em> to a <em>Late</em> you will need to use the class blog to submit a late notification. Failure to do this in a timely manner upon arrival to class will result in your late arrival remaining an absence. Lates will be recorded in twenty minute increments. For every 110 minutes you are late, you will receive an absence. Unlike your absences in the class dashboard, lates will not be automatically tallied into your final grade, so I will be doing that manually at the end of the semester.</p>

<p>A final course grade of <em>Incomplete</em> will only be assigned to students who currently have a passing grade of a “B” or higher who are unable to complete the course due to a serious illness or personal tragedy that is well documented and out of their control.</p>

<p><strong>Unless UMBC officially closes, there are no excused absences for weather.</strong></p>

<h3 id="final-exam-attendance">Final Exam Attendance</h3>
<p>The final exam will be held during the final exam period posted on the UMBC website for our class. The final exam could consist of a critique, a presentation, in class quiz, or simply turning in assignment files. In person attendance for the final exam is mandatory. Failure to attend the final exam will result in lowering your final course grade by one letter grade.</p>

<p>The only excused final exam absences—illness or participation in UMBC organized mandatory activities or a common final exam with an overlapping time—must be accompanied by a note from the UMBC Student Health Center, another health care provider, or UMBC faculty/coach.</p>

<h2 id="assignments">Assignments</h2>

<h3 id="in-class-assignments">In-Class Assignments</h3>
<p><em>Class</em> assignments are to be completed in <em>class</em>. The reason for this is class assignments are meant to replicate the speed that you will need to work at once you entry the industry. To ensure that you are using your class time wisely, and working quickly, you must upload your work at the end of each class through the blog. Remember, everything you upload is timestamped, so I’ll know <strong>exactly</strong> when you uploaded it. Failure to upload your project by the end of class will automatically result in a zero for that day. If you are not in class to work on the assignment, you will also receive a zero on the assignment. There are no exceptions to this policy.</p>

<p>When you are in ART 336 you should be working on ART 336 assignments. Working on projects for other art studio courses or studying for quizzes demonstrates that you do not have enough ART 336 assignments to fill up the 2 contact hours for each class period. If I continually see you working on the screencasts, outside projects, etc. I will assign additional exercises to help make you better web designers: the goal of the course.</p>

<h3 id="screencast-assignments">Screencast Assignments</h3>
<p>I have created a series of screencasts with the goal of teaching you just enough HTML and CSS to understand the medium you are designing for and to test out your design choices before you hand them off to a developer. The screencasts will need to be completed on time. Each builds off the previous and they are directly timed to coincide with the class assignments. By the middle of the semester you should be using what you learned in the screencast in class. If you don’t keep up with the screencasts you wont be able to complete the in class assignments. Not completing the assignments will severely affect your final course grade.</p>

<h3 id="assignment-questions">Assignment Questions</h3>
<p>24 hours prior to a project or exercise being due I will not answer assignment related questions via email or before/during/after class. You should not be starting an assignment 48 hours before it’s due! I will still answer assignment related questions regardless of deadline if you stop by during my office hours.</p>

<h3 id="grading">Grading</h3>
<p>Over the course of the semester you will earn points by completing in class assignments and screencasts for homework. Because every in class assignment and screencast is different, each will have its own grading rubric describing how I will be assessing the work. Be sure to carefully review each assignment or screencast blog post and its grading rubric to ensure you have successfully completed the entire assignment. Assignments and screencasts will range anywhere from 5 to 25 points depending on complexity with clearly identified point values on the specific assignment’s blog post.</p>

<p>The in class assignments and the screencasts you will be doing for homework are weighted evenly, each worth 50% of the final semester grade. This means that you have to complete both the assignments (150 points) and screencasts (150 points) to successfully pass the course. Failure to keep up with either  will result in a low or failing grade! As a reminder, since ART 336 is a requirement for the Graphic Design major, you will need to earn a letter grade of “C” or higher to have it count towards the major. Anything below a “C” will result in you needing to retake the course. It is also important for you to remember that you can only attempt a course three times. If you do not pass, or you withdraw from a course three times, you will not be able to take future courses in the major. When you attempt to retake a course for the second or third time, you will need to get a waiver for the registrar’s office which has very specific deadlines!</p>

<h4 id="late-work-incompletes-and-make-up">Late Work, Incompletes, and Make-Up</h4>
<p>Professionalism will be stressed. Treat this class as you would a job. Late arrival to a client meeting or missed deadlines will cost you a job and your ex-employer a client. Therefore, all assignments must be completed on time, and are due at the beginning of class.</p>

<p>An assignment not ready for the start of class will be considered late. Assignments lose 10% each day <em>not class period</em> they are late. Assignments over 7 days late will be given a <strong>0</strong>, no exceptions. Turn in your Assignments even if you aren’t finished, it’s better to turn in <strong>something</strong>. Getting partial points is better than getting a <strong>0</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="umbc-statement-of-values-for-academic-integrity">UMBC Statement of Values for Academic Integrity</h2>
<p>By enrolling in this course, each student assumes the responsibilities of an active participant in UMBC’s scholarly community in which everyone’s academic work and behavior are held to the highest standards of honesty. Cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, and helping others to commit these acts are all forms of academic dishonesty, and they are wrong. Academic misconduct could result in disciplinary action that may include, but is not limited to, suspension or dismissal. To read the full Student Academic Conduct Policy, consult UMBC policies, or the Faculty Handbook (Section 14.3). For graduate courses, see the Graduate School website.</p>

<h3 id="use-of-stock-photography-and-other-imagery">Use of Stock Photography and Other Imagery</h3>
<blockquote>
	Your portfolio is just another word for your reputation, which is just another word for your integrity.
	<cite><a href="https://twitter.com/monteiro" target="_blank">@monteiro</a></cite>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a very small place in the industry for the use of stock photography, imagery, and code. However, as a designer you are hired on your ability to create visual content, not use content created by others. There aren’t any legitimate design jobs for designers who use the work of others claiming it as their own, or using it because you don’t want to create your own. If all designers had to do was buy or steal the work from others, why would anybody need a designer?</p>

<p>In this class, this means that all imagery used during the semester must be your own or supplied by me. If I suspect that you have copied the work of others I will ask to see your original sketches and digital files. If you find work that is listed as creative commons, technically you are free to use it if you cite the original author, but again, you are designers and you are the content generators.</p>

<h2 id="access-and-accommodations">Access and Accommodations</h2>
<p>UMBC is committed to eliminating discriminatory obstacles that disadvantage students based on disability. <a href="http://humanrelations.umbc.edu/disabilitysec-504/student-support/" target="_blank" title="Student Support / Academic Accommodation">Student Support / Academic Accommodation</a> is the UMBC department designated to:</p>
