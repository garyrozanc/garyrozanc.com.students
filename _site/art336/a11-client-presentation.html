    		<p>For the final, you will give exactly an 8 minute (timed) presentation to the class on why your design decisions are the best choices for the client. Be sure to avoid the “Tourist” description where you literally describe what the prototype looks like. Unless the client is blind, they can see what it looks like. What they don’t know is why the design you created are the best solution to solve their problems.</p>

<p>While you are presenting, be sure to say why the color choices are best, why the font choices are best, why the layout is best, etc. Give very specific reasons. You will need to create a Prezi, Google Slides, PowerPoint, or Keynote presentation to show during your client presentation.</p>

<p>As you saw via email, you will have EXACTLY 8 minutes to present! The presentation order is listed below.</p>

<p><del>We could also start at 12 noon and give everyone 15 minutes to present and keep going till we are finished.</del></p>
