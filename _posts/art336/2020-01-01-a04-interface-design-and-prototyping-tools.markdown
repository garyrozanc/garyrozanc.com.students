Software does not make the designer. If this were the case everyone would be a graphic designer. As James Victore said, “Give me a piece of black paper and a pair of scissors and I&rsquo;ll kick your ass.” Good graphic design fundamentals that transcend software are what truly make the designer.

However, software can make you faster, _if you pick the right tool for the job and you learn to use it efficiently_. For example, you would not use InDesign or Photoshop to create a vector illustration nor use InDesign or Illustrator to edit photos. However I see emerging designers using the wrong tools all the time.

When it comes to interactive design (app and web) there is a fundamentally different deliverable from print design that requires specialized tools. Digital files for a printed design piece go to a commercial printer. Digital files for an application or website go to a developer. The app or website developer needs to reference completely different information from the digital files than a commercial printer needs. The fundamental differences don&rsquo;t stop at final output. There are several deliverables for interactive design such as wireframes, user flows and prototypes that you will be expected to create. These deliverables can be created using everything from pen and paper to HTML/CSS. 

Going back to the purpose of software in the first place, speed, new interface design tools have been flooding the market. These new tools when used efficiently can considerably speed up the time it takes you to produce a deliverable. FYI: you will hear terms like interface, prototyping, layout, etc. used to describe the tools and they are basically all the same thing, each with their own unique focus. Some of the programs you may be asked to use are  [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) (browser based), [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) (the current industry standard), [Studio](https://www.invisionapp.com/studio) (not sure where they stand at the moment), and [XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html) (really late to the party, but throwing serious resources at it lately) for your projects.

It is hard for me to recommend a specific tool at this time because they all have advantages and disadvantages that I will discuss in class, but I&rsquo;m going to say Xd is the safe bet becuase it&rsquo;s part of Creative Clound with Sketch still considered the industry standard.

## What is Efficiency?

Before I discuss what efficient use of interface design tools looks like, I want to discuss speed. I&rsquo;m going to guess that as a student you get anywhere from 2 to 4 major projects each semester in your studio courses. Each of these projects will last from 3 to 7 weeks. Do you know how long you get on a project at a design firm? 8 hours if you are lucky (well for the initial comps anyway). Because there are so many people working on a website from developers to user experience designers, to quality control, time for graphic design is limited. Therefore you need to work as fast and efficiently as possible.

Let&rsquo;s use InDesign as an example. Every time I watch emerging designers work on a book project I&rsquo;ll see them go through their document and change headlines fonts, spacing, color, etc. manually because they never setup stylesheets. If they had setup stylesheets, they could make the adjustment once and have it apply to each instance throughout the book. Using style sheets in InDesign saves time and makes you a quicker designer. Interface design tools have the same feature. Sketch calls it [Symbols](https://sketchapp.com/docs/symbols/), Studio calls them [Components](https://support.invisionapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000095403) and Xd uses [Assets](https://helpx.adobe.com/xd/help/assets-symbols.html) and [Compenents](https://helpx.adobe.com/xd/help/assets-symbols.html#Symbols), formerly called _Symbols_. So, while it&rsquo;s easy to jump into the programs and mockup a design, you are wasting an enormous amount of time by not learning how to use the tool for expediency.

## Assignment

For the rest of the class you are required to create products cards placed on smartphone and laptop artboards that have the following elements created using assets and components in Adobe Xd. I will set a timer and you will have 45 minutes for the laptop artboard, a 10 minute break, then 25 minutes for the smartphone arboard. Focus on setting each element up as an asset or component, not the design!

1. Logo
2. Hero Image with Text
3. Call to Action with Text
4. 16 Product Cards Using Repeat Grid
    - Image
    - Price
    - Title
    - Model Number

**Bonus Points:** You will receive 10 extra points if you add hover states with the extra images to each product on the grid!

## Grading
This assignment will be worth 10 points and is due by the end of class. Name the files exactly as follows (all lowercase with hyphens and no blank spaces) **interface-design-tools-firstname-lastname.(xd)**, and upload the two files via the DropBox link by the end of class.

### Learning Objectives Applied
- Applying
    - Make use of an interactive design process.
    - Construct interactive designs with prototyping software.
- Analyzing
    - Assess interactive prototypes for responsive web design principles.

### Assessment Rubric
- If you received **6&ndash;10 points** you demonstrated the use of assets, components, or symbols in two interface design program.
- If you received **1&ndash;5 points** you demonstrated the use of assets, components, or symbols in one of interface design program.
- If you received **0 points** you did not turn in files that demonstrate the use of assets, components, or symbols.
