For the final, you will give exactly an 8 minute (timed) presentation to the class on why your design decisions are the best choices for the client. Be sure to avoid the &#8220;Tourist&#8221; description where you literally describe what the prototype looks like. Unless the client is blind, they can see what it looks like. What they don&#8217;t know is why the design you created are the best solution to solve their problems. 

While you are presenting, be sure to say why the color choices are best, why the font choices are best, why the layout is best, etc. Give very specific reasons. You will need to create a Prezi, Google Slides, PowerPoint, or Keynote presentation to show during your client presentation.

As you saw via email, you will have EXACTLY 8 minutes to present! The presentation order is listed below.

<del>We could also start at 12 noon and give everyone 15 minutes to present and keep going till we are finished.</del>

## Grading
This presentation will be worth 50 points and will be due at the beginning of class on 05.15.18. Remember this along with your <a href="a11-building-prototypes.html" target="_blank" title="Clickable Prototype">Clickable Prototype</a> is your final exam! Attendance is mandatory per the course syllabus.

- If you received between **34&ndash;50 points** your presentation focused on telling the client the importance of your design decisions and how those decisions will solve the client&#8217;s problems.
- If you received between **17&ndash;33 points** your presentation was a mix of describing what the website looked like and why you made the design decisions, but were lacking description on how the designs help solve the problem.
- If you received between **0&ndash;16 points** you either didn&#8217;t do your presentation, or it was a description of what the website looked like and not how it could help the client.
