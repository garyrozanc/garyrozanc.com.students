[Atomic Design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) is a methodology developed by [Brad Frost](https://twitter.com/brad_frost) to help designers and developers focus on content types not fixed device sizes (think phone, tablet, laptop, etc.). Another benefit of the Atomic Design methodology is it naturally lends itself to the creation of a Design System. Remember, while we haven’t discussed design systems yet, a design system will be your final client deliverable, not a website or webpage!

So what is Atomic Design? In a crazy over simplification a group of atoms (buttons, headlines, single form input, etc.) combine to form molecules (form, card, navigation, carousel, etc.). Those molecules combine to form organisms (site header and footer, menus, featured sections, etc.). Finally, organisms combine to form webpages. For an in-depth explanation of Atomic Design read [Brad’s article](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) or check out his [Atomic Design](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/) book. It is also important to note that atomic design, design systems, pattern libraries, ui libraries, etc. for the purpose of this course are the same thing. They are simply terms used to describe a collection of elements that compose a webpage. Once you get into the industry, these terms will take on more specific and discernible meanings.

For today’s class, using the supplied <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/pdc9bawrcny6q8s/art336-tracing-atomic-design.zip?dl=0" target="_blank" title="Template Illustrator Files">Illustrator files</a>, you will pick **two** of the websites listed below and trace the atoms, molecules, and organisms for the webpage. You may not finish the second one, and that's OK! In the Illustrator file you will find a full page screenshot, several different layers for doing the tracings, and swatches with the colors for tracing on the appropriate layer.
