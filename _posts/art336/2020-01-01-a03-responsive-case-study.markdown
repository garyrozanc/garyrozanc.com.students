On May 25th 2010 Ethan Marcotte wrote the seminal article <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design" target="_blank" title="Responsive Web Design: Ethan Marcotte">Responsive Web Design</a>, the basis for the modern web. In the article Ethan discusses how fluid grids, flexible images, and media queries let websites respond to a user&rsquo;s device and deliver an appropriately sized layout.

Your assignment will be to work with your group over the next hour and ten minutes and review one of the responsive websites listed below. After doing some research, your group will put together a 6 minute summary—no slides, just the website—for presentation to the class today that covers the following:

- **Goals:** Was this a redesign of an existing site to make it responsive or built from the ground up? Why did the client want to go responsive? Did the design team have to convince the client to go responsive?
- **(Re)Design:** A lot goes into designing or redesigning a website. What processes were used for team collaboration (and what type of professionals were on the team), what tools were used for building, communication, etc. How was testing done to ensure usability for all users, and accessibility for people with disabilities? 
- **Success:** Was the (re)design successful? How was success measured? Increased sales, traffic, conversions, etc.
- **Working Method:** How was the project completed and who was involved? Was it a design firm, was it a remote team, was it an in-house team, etc.? How did they conduct client meetings if local client? What if the client was remote?
- **Report/Demo:** Show the class the website specifically demonstrating different breakpoints. Tell us what you think works well and what could be improved.

## Grading
This assignment will be worth 10 points and is due at the end of class. Email me a link to a Google Doc or a Word doc with the names of your group&rsquo;s members, the website you studied and a couple of bullet points that you discuss during the class report for each category: Goals, (Re)Design, Success, and Working Methods before you leave class.

### Learning Objectives Applied
- Applying
    - Make use of an interactive design process.
- Analyzing
    - Assess interactive prototypes for responsive web design principles.
- Evaluating
    - Explain and defend design choices through formal presentations.    

### Assessment Rubric
- **6–10:** The presentation includes details about each of the three goals. The group is well prepared and familiar with their assigned website and the class gets insight from the presentation.
- **3–5:** The presentation includes the required parts, but could have used more detail and research in order to back up their findings. The class learns a few things, but not anything they couldn&rsquo;t have learned from clicking on the initial links below.
- **0–2:** The presentation is missing one or more of the required parts, and the group is not familiar with their website they were assigned. The presentation does not give the class info on the process or inform them of anything new.
