Throughout this course you will be creating HTML and CSS documents, using web fonts, and images on your computer. Working on the files directly on your computer is a great strategy because you don&rsquo;t have to worry about a slow, or non-existent internet connection, web server issues, etc., or litany of other potential issues. However, unless your computer is setup as a web server with a 24/7 connection to the internet, the page you create won&rsquo;t be viewable by anyone unless they are sitting at your computer.

Since you want the speed benefits of working on the HTML and CSS files on your computer, but also want them out there for the world to see, you need to get your files onto a computer—web server—with a 24/7 connection to the internet. Since I&rsquo;m supplying you the web server, all you need is a way to transfer the files you create during this course from your computer to the web server. Fortunately the File Transfer Protocol, better know as FTP, lets you move files from one computer to another via an internet connection. 

You may have also heard of this process referred to as SFTP, or Secure File Transfer Protocol. SFTP functions the same way as FTP, with one exception, encryption. With the SFTP process files sent between your computer and the web server are encrypted. This extra layer of security ensures that sensitive data sent between the two computers isn&rsquo;t readable if it were hacked by someone. For this course, you will use FTP, not SFTP since none of the data you are sending to the remote web server is sensitive.

To utilize the File Transfer Protocol you need a FTP client. There are many FTP clients available for both macOS and Windows. <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/" target="_blank" title="FileZilla - The free FTP solution"><a href="https://panic.com/transmit/" target="_blank" title="Transmit 5">Transmit 5</a></a> and <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/" target="_blank" title="FIlezilla">Filezilla</a> are some of the more popular ones, but for this course you will be using <a href="https://cyberduck.io/?l=en" target="_blank" title="Cyberduck | Libre FTP, SFTP, WebDAV, S3, Backblaze B2 & OpenStack Swift browser for Mac and Windows">Cyberduck</a>. Since it&rsquo;s open source, multi-platform, with a revenue stream I thinks it&rsquo;s the best choice for us. Another bonus is that if you are a macOS user, the interface will seem very familiar to you.
