## Do not start unless…
Before you begin to design elements, you need to know what elements will need to be designed! While some elements—icons and headlines with body copy—are universal, many aren’t. Even more important, your elements are not random visuals. They serve a purpose, wether to increase sales or donations, increase the average time on a page, or get newsletter signups. Therefore, you need to know what elements to design and their key functions. Both pieces of information come from the [Information Architecture](https://gary.is/art336/a07b-information-architecture.html) phase. So, before you start designing, make sure you have your wireframes! 

Once you have a list containing all the elements that are on the site (from your wireframe) and you have a visual direction based on the [mood deck](https://gary.is/art336/a07d-art-direction-vs-graphic-design.html) and [style tile](https://gary.is/art336/a07d-art-direction-vs-graphic-design.html), you can start designing those elements. Focus on the actual elements, not on their placement within the artboard. You can rearrange them later. I’ve included links to examples of element collages below. As for the number of elements: a lot, experiment. Multiples of each element…actually, multiples of multiples. This phase is about quantity and exploration of ideas. Don’t forget, your elements should be based on the choices you made in the style tiles!

Finally, create your elements on an artboard in either Figma, Sketch, Studio, or Xd. Your artboards should be 2300×1440 pixels. This will allow you to proportionally scale it to fit an 11×17 inch tabloid size piece of paper in landscape. The 2300×1440 pixel dimension is also the size of larger laptops or smaller desktop screens, so make your elements with that scale in mind. You will most likely need to create multiple artboards.

To help you visualize what an Element Collage is, I’ve found a few examples. However, please keep in mind that most of the examples are the final version presented to the client. Yours should not be neat and orderly…unless that is your natural working method.
