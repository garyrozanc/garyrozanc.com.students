## Personas
You are not designing for your client. You are designing for your client&rsquo;s audience and users. You will not always have direct access to your client&rsquo;s audience. Even if you do have direct access, you will not have 24/7 access while the project is in the visual design phase. To work around this problem, research is done by user experience designers to fully understand audiences and users. Often, user experience designers will create personas that represent a typical audience or user.

This persona will be the baseline for whom you are designing your website for. As you are going through the visual design process, you will need to make design decisions that will move your audience or users into action. Your persona will be a constant reference point that your design choices visually sync with the client&rsquo;s audience and users. 

Your personas need to be saved as PDFs. Please note you will be sharing your persona&rsquo;s with the entire class. This will allow everyone to use multiple personas to inform their design decisions. So please take this exercise seriously. Not all personas will be applicable to your website, so you only will reference personas that parallel your audience and users.

### Questions to answer or consider as you work on your slides

#### General Description
- **Name:** Use a realistic name. Don&rsquo;t use names of friends, family or colleagues.
- **Quote:** Capture the essence to one or two points that could come out of the persona&rsquo;s own mouth - so to speak.
- **Who is it?** Sketch the personal profile, age, location, job title, what kind of person is it? Think about one or more personas from segmentation.
- **What Goals?** What is the supreme motivator? What are (latent) needs and desires?
- **What Attitude?** What is the point of view? What is the expectation, perception of the service, company or brand. What motivates the persona to go to the website, into the shop, or use the service.
- **Which Behavior?** What does your persona do? Tell stories about their behavior while using a service, product or site. Channel usage for various needs (internet, visiting comparable sites, mobile, social media). What works well, what are the frustrations, what is stopping them from choosing a function, service or product?

#### Process
- Describe a typical day. What do they do when they first get up? What do they do next?
- How do they complete a certain task?
- How long does this task typically take?
- Where would they start?
- What would they do next?
- What activities take up most of their time?
- What activities are most important to their success?

#### Pain Points
- What are the most difficult, challenging, annoying or frustrating aspects of your persona&rsquo;s daily life?
- After a typical day, what about your persona&rsquo;s day (if anything) is still on their mind? (In other words, what issues keep them up at night?)

### Grading
#### Learning Objectives Applied
- Applying
    - Make use of an interactive design process.
- Analyzing
    - Assess interactive prototypes for responsive web design principles.
- Evaluating
    - Explain and defend design choices through formal presentations.

#### Assessment Rubric
- If you received between **4&ndash;5 points** you successfully created and presented a thoughtful persona that gave insight into the problems the persona faces from day to day.
- If you received between **2&ndash;3 points** you successfully created and presented a persona that gave some insight into the problems the persona faces from day to day.
- If you received between **0&ndash;1 points** you did not successfully create or present a thoughtful persona that gave insight into the problems the persona faces from day to day.

## Heuristic Evaluation
Now that you know the subject of your semester long project, you need to do some real research and use the product or service that you are designing for. To formalize the research you will need to do a <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/" target="_blank" title="10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design">Heuristic Evaluation</a> while **USING** that product or service in real life context by answering the 10 Usability Heuristics questions listed in the article. Be sure to record your evaluation throughly.

<blockquote>Simply reviewing a “A similar product or service” isn&rsquo;t a viable option for your client or for this project. Don&rsquo;t ask!</blockquote>

Below are the <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/" target="_blank" title="10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design">10 Usability Heuristics</a> for User Interface Design questions that you will be using to evaluate the [devopsdays Baltimore](https://devopsdays.org/events/2020-baltimore/welcome/).

### 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design

1. **Visibility of system status:** The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.
2. **Match between system and the real world:** The system should speak the users&rsquo; language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.
3. **User control and freedom:** Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked “emergency exit” to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo.
4. **Consistency and standards:* Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/do-interface-standards-stifle-design-creativity/" target="_blank">platform conventions</a>.
5. **Error prevention:** Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action. (Read full article on <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/slips/" target="_blank">preventing user errors</a>.)
6. **Recognition rather than recall:** Minimize the user&rsquo;s memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate. (Read full article on <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/recognition-and-recall/" target="_blank">recognition vs. recall in UX</a>.)
7. **Flexibility and efficiency of use:** Accelerators — unseen by the novice user — may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.
8. **Aesthetic and minimalist design:** Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.
9. **Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors:** <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/error-message-guidelines/" target="_blank">Error messages</a> should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.
10. **Help and documentation:** Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large.
