<blockquote>
&lsquo;I had a client who expected me to be available at odd hours and was kind of demanding,&rsquo; says Erika Rains DeBlasi from Advisor Expressions. &lsquo;The tipping point was when I saw him at Whole Foods as I was on my way to be induced. We stopped to get a few snacks to have at the hospital after the baby arrived. I had notified all my clients and put someone else in charge of the accounts. When we ran into him at the store, he starting immediately taking to me about work, even after I reminded him that I was on my way to the hospital. I knew then I had to fire someone who couldn&rsquo;t show me any respect or consideration. It wasn&rsquo;t worth it.&rsquo;

This is just one example of an unhealthy client relationship. Being harassed by a client while shopping is unavoidable, but being asked for endless revisions or new features can be avoided. To avoid these pitfalls, designers need to put everything that you will be delivering to the client in writing, and how you will handle the process.

- The Deliverables: What are you going to give the client.
- The Schedule: When you are you going to give the client the deliverables.*
    - 02.17 or 02.19: Initial Client Meeting
    - 03.09 or 03.11 Art Direction Presentation
    - 04.06 or 04.08 Design System Presentation 
    - 05.18 Client Pitch
- The Process: How you are going to show the deliverables during the course of the project.
- The Expectations: How many revisions, how many new features, etc.
