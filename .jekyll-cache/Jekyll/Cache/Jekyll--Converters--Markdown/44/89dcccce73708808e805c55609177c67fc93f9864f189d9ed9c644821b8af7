I"ú<p>Tools like Adobe Xd, InVision, and Sketch give you the ability to create clickable prototypes and make it easy to send a non-responsive version of your visual design to view on a smartphone or tablet device. However, relying on these prototypes for accurate evaluation is problematic. For example, in <strong>Figure 1</strong>, the screenshot on the left is a visual design created in Sketch specifically sized for the iPhone 7 Plus, viewed using the Sketch Mirror app on an iPhone 7 Plus. The screenshot on the right is a visual design created specifically for the iPhone 4s, viewed on an iPhone 7 Plus. While not ideal, you can still estimate what your smaller sized designs will look like on a slightly larger screen, the same isnâ€™t true in reverse.</p>
