I"à<p>As I previously mentioned there are a lot of initial steps that happen simultaneously when starting a web project. However, I think if there was one clear starting point, it would be with the content. Before you can start the visual designâ€”different from art directionâ€”you need to know what your designing. Before user research can really get into full swing, userâ€™s need content to interact with to be observed. Finally, you need content before you can organize the content into sections, pages, etc.</p>

<p>However, not every project is a simple redesign with existing content. Startups start from scratch. Even redesigns could be creating new content. So, depending on the needs of the client, this phase/step will look very different. For example, our two clients for the semester demonstrate the extremes of this process. Professor Marmor is basically stating from scratch, while Bmoresponsive has a lot of content that will most likely be used again. Each of these clients will need a different approach.</p>

<h2 id="professor-marmor">Professor Marmor</h2>
<p>Since Professor Marmor doesnâ€™t have a site for us to conduct and inventory, we need to do some educated guessing to determine the siteâ€™s content. To do this educated guessing I suggest starting with the <a href="https://gary.is/art336/a07b-information-architecture.html">Information Architecture</a>. By starting there we will at least know what pages the site will have and then you can review the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/hb1m3sh9h3bw0p3/art336_marmor_389.zip?dl=0">materials that were already provided</a> and your notes from the client discovery meeting and form a list of existing and missing content.</p>

<p>This assignment is worth 10 points. You can either send me a link to a Google Doc, or <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/request/GvTToyRejnw4w4AyPeFx">upload a PDF file to Dropbox</a> by the end of the class on March 4th.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you received <strong>6â€“10 points</strong> you identified missing content to request from the client, and compiled the content you currently have into a workable document.</li>
  <li>If you received <strong>1â€“5 points</strong> you suggested some easy to identify content to request from the client, but did not completely compiled the content you currently have into a workable document.</li>
  <li>If you received <strong>0 points</strong> you did not complete the in-class assignment.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bmoresponsive">Bmoresponsive</h2>
<p>You will use this <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/umbc.edu/spreadsheets/d/1POid-yXrlX6X1DrcoLfvNSVcejCvG_IwnR-KfNSLA4E/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" title="Content Inventory">Google Sheet</a> as a template to conduct a site inventory of <a href="http://bmoresponsive.com/">Bmoresponsive</a>. Do not work in this document, rather copy it and create your own and share a link with me at the end of class. Be sure to include your team members name in the final inventory. Your site inventory will contain the following information that we will cover during class.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Navigation Title:</strong> The name of the main navigation link to the content (e.g. the link title in the main navigation).</li>
  <li><strong>Page Title:</strong> The displayed page title.</li>
  <li><strong>URL:</strong> Display the URL.</li>
  <li><strong>Content Type:</strong> Is this a basic page, publication, news story, article, technique, FAQ, or something else?</li>
  <li><strong>Content Description:</strong> A brief, basic description that serves as a reminder about whatâ€™s on the page.</li>
  <li><strong>Media &amp; Downloads:</strong> List of all media on each page including: image, video and audio files.</li>
  <li><strong>Links:</strong> List of links into and out of each page.</li>
  <li><strong>Comments:</strong> Notes and things for you to remember. Consider listing things you liked or disliked about the page.</li>
</ol>
