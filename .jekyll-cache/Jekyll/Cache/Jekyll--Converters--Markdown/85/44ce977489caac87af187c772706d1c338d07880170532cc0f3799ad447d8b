I"«<p>In the <em>01 Domain Names</em> exercise you pointed your domain name to the course web hosting server located at 45.55.166.182. However, a web server can host multiple websites. Simply pointing your domain name to a web serverâ€™s IP address wonâ€™t tell the web browser where your specific files are located. Web servers are very similar to apartment buildings in how their addresses are organized. For example a street address will point to a single apartment building much like an IP address will point to a single web server. Within an apartment building there are individual apartments each with their own unique address, and web servers are setup exactly the same way.</p>
