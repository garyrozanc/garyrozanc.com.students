I"5<p>Full disclosure, I’m getting a lot of <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/art-direction-and-design">this material from Dan Mall</a>. I suggest that you read his article as I’m only giving you the highlights. Now on to the topic at hand. With print design, generally you are designing a single page that is a fixed size. Even books have a limited number of page variations, and they are all the same size. Websites have multiple pages, at multiple sizes, with widely varying content. This gives the designer a lot to design versus a poster or business card. Since there is a lot to design for a website, you want to be efficient as possible. Spending a lot of time on revisions to the visual design will drive up costs (that may not be billable), slow down font-end development, and put the project behind.</p>
