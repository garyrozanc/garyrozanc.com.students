I"	<p>To help understand the web as a design medium, you will first need to get content on the web so it’s viewable on different devices and browsers. To get started, you will need two interrelated services: a place to store—host—your content online and a physical address so others can easily find the location of the hosted content you will be creating. In this exercise I will be discussing the physical address of the hosted files, the hosting of files will be covered in the <em>02</em> Web Hosting exercise.</p>
