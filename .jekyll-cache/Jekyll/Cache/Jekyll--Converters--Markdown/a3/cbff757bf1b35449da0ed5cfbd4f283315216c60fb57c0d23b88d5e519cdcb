<p>Throughout this course you will be creating HTML and CSS documents, using web fonts, and images on your computer. Working on the files directly on your computer is a great strategy because you don’t have to worry about a slow, or non-existent internet connection, web server issues, etc., or litany of other potential issues. However, unless your computer is setup as a web server with a 24/7 connection to the internet, the page you create won’t be viewable by anyone unless they are sitting at your computer.</p>
