I"`<p>There are many think pieces out there making the claim that the web is primarily composed of 95% typography<sup><a href="#one" target="_blank" title="Resource Article #1" class="scroll">1</a>,<a href="#two" target="_blank" title="Resource Article #2" class="scroll">2</a></sup>. I’m not going to argue the science and accuracy of these claims, I bring it up because even if you don’t believe the stats, you can’t argue that there is a lot of reading done on screen based devices and it’s the graphic designer’s job to make sure all the content is presented in the most legible way possible.</p>
