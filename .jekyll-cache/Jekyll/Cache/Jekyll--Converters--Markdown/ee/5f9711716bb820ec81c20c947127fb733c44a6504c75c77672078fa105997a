I"v<p>Software does not make the designer. If this were the case everyone would be a graphic designer. As James Victore said, “Give me a piece of black paper and a pair of scissors and I’ll kick your ass.” Good graphic design fundamentals that transcend software are what truly make the designer. However, software can make you faster, <em>if you pick the right tool for the job and you learn to use it efficiently</em>. For example, you would not use InDesign or Photoshop to create a vector illustration nor use InDesign or Illustrator to edit photos. However I see emerging designers using the wrong tools all the time.</p>
