I"X<p>Before you begin to put pencil to paper for a design, you need to know more than what the client asked you to design. I’m going to use a real world example that I’m still looking for the actual source (I read it in a book), but I also heard the story first hand from the actual designer. Early on, VH1’s viewership was dropping. To combat this, VH1 was looking for a visual rebrand to help increase viewers and reached out to several design firms. One firm, <a href="http://adamsmorioka.com/">AdamsMorioka</a>, countered with “We could give you a new identity, but we can’t guarantee that will increase viewership.” Instead of doing a rebrand, AdamsMorioka came back with the suggestion of coming up with new programming that attracted the audience VH1 wanted to target. Then, this new programming would feed into a new visual identity.</p>
