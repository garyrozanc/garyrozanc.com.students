I"™<p>Devices donâ€™t come in fixed sizes such as extra-small (wearables), small (smartphone), medium (tablet), large (laptop), and extra-large (desktop). Yet, this is how emerging designers approach designing for the web. They start designing using the size of their own device and stop there. On occasion an emerging designer will create a second design for a different sized device. Notice I wrote <em>create a second design</em>. When someone visits a website the experienceâ€”both functionally and visuallyâ€”should be seamless across devices. This is a vastly different concept needing a unique design approach, not simply <em>creating a second design</em>.</p>
