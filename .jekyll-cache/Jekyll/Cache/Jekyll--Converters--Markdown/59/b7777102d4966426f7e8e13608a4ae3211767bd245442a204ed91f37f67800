I"<p>As I previously mentioned there are a lot of initial steps that happen simultaneously when starting a web project. However, I think if there was one clear starting point, it would be with the content. Before you can start the visual design—different from art direction—you need to know what your designing. Before user research can really get into full swing, user’s need content to interact with to be observed. Finally, you need content before you can organize the content into sections, pages, etc.</p>
