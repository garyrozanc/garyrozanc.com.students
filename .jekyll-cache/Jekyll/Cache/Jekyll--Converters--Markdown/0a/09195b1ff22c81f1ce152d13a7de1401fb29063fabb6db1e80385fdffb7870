<p>You are not designing for your client. You are designing for your client’s audience and users. You will not always have direct access to your client’s audience. Even if you do have direct access, you will not have 24/7 access while the project is in the visual design phase. To work around this problem, research is done by user experience designers to fully understand audiences and users. Often, user experience designers will create personas that represent a typical audience or user.</p>
