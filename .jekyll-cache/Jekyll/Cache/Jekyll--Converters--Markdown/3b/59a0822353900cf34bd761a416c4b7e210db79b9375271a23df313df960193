<p>Now that you have content, wireframes, style tiles, and element collages, itâ€™s finally time to start mocking up your website. You will need to mockup each of the necessary pages using either Adobe XD CC, Figma, InVision Studio, or Sketch. Each page will have a minimum of two sizes, small and large. I would suggest that you create artboards that are the size of the devices <em>you own</em>. This will allow you to test your design decisions as close to a 1 to 1 ratio as possible. Just remember that this 1 to 1 ration is <em>your ratio</em> not necessarily the how the users will be viewing it.</p>
