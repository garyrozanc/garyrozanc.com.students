I"Ç$<p>Before you begin to put pencil to paper for a design, you need to know more than what the client asked you to design. I‚Äôm going to use a real world example that I‚Äôm still looking for the actual source (I read it in a book), but I also heard the story first hand from the actual designer. Early on, VH1‚Äôs viewership was dropping. To combat this, VH1 was looking for a visual rebrand to help increase viewers and reached out to several design firms. One firm, <a href="http://adamsmorioka.com/">AdamsMorioka</a>, countered with ‚ÄúWe could give you a new identity, but we can‚Äôt guarantee that will increase viewership.‚Äù Instead of doing a rebrand, AdamsMorioka came back with the suggestion of coming up with new programming that attracted the audience VH1 wanted to target. Then, this new programming would feed into a new visual identity.</p>

<p>Instead of blindly following the client‚Äôs request, AdamsMorioka did some research, found the real problem, and offered a fitting solution. That solution became the impetus for the ubiquitous <em>I Heart the [blank]‚Äôs</em> programming. The point of this example is to demonstrate that the client <em>knows</em> the problem. On the surface, a [blank] (insert website, logo, app, etc. here) may seem like a good choice to solve that problem. However, it‚Äôs your job in the age of analytics to ensure the visual design solution solves the <em>actual</em> problem‚Äîthrough research.</p>

<h2 id="step-one-presearch">Step One: Presearch</h2>

<p>There is no consistent way that you will obtain work, wether as a freelancer, working at a firm, or as part of an in-house team. The initial work query could come to you as an email or web contact form, word of mouth, phone call, etc. Regardless of the initial form of contact you will eventually need to meet with the client. That meeting will be your initial ‚Äú<a href="https://alistapart.com/article/discovery-on-a-budget-part-i">Discovery Meeting</a>‚Äù, but what do you do <em>before</em> that initial meeting with the client? Well, you could sit on your hands and do nothing, or you could do some preresearch. Using the information supplied to you by the client, try to figure out the problem they need solved. Try and find out about their competitors, what they do well, etc. Remember, you won‚Äôt necessarily have the project yet. Going into that first meeting armed with as much knowledge about the company and the problem as possible will instill confidence and trust between you and the client.</p>

<p>Your task for the rest of the class will be to look over each of the projects and prepare as much as you can for the initial discovery meeting with the client that will take place next class (02.13.19). You will have 45 minutes to research each client.</p>

## Part XXX: Stages of Action

So why are you doing research? Advertisers and designers generally assume that creating some form of design will motivate someone into action. This is the farthest thing from the truth. Medical and Physiological research has shown that there is a lot more involved when it comes to changing a person or group‚Äôs behavior (moving someone into action). A single piece of design can not motivate someone from a state of unawareness to action and make that action habitual. 

What design can do is motivate someone from one state of awareness into another. By researching your intended audience‚Äôs level of understanding of the subject of your design piece, you can determine the best approach to moving them into action.

The following break down of how ready people are to change was researched and written by Carlo C. DiClemente and James Prochaska. There are many other medical studies on changing behavior but most of them are some variation on the Six Stages of Action listed below.

## The Six Stages of Action

1. **Precontemplation:** the period before you are aware that a change is necessary. Another word for Precontemplation is denial.
2. **Contemplation:** once you‚Äôve moved out of Precontemplation, you are willing to understand the truth about the problem behavior or situation and consider the alternatives. Contemplation is the learning stage in which you gather information.
3. **Planning:** once you have committed to bringing about a change in your life, the next step is to figure out how to do it. You plan your behavior change.
4. **Action:** you implement your plan in the Action phase. This phase can be seen as an experiment in which you learn which parts of your plan work and where the unforeseen obstacles lie.
5. **Maintenance:** most people enter the Action stage filled with enthusiasm and excitement. There is a sense of euphoria as they begin to see positive change and experience the benefits that this change brings. It is much more of a challenge to maintain that change.
6. **Termination:** once the new habits have replaced the old, maladaptive behaviors you can consider yourself in what Prochaska labels the Termination phase. In Transformation, the desired change has been accomplished.

### Grading

This assignment will be worth 12 points. You can email me a link, a document, or hand them in on paper.

- If you received between **8&ndash;12 points** you came up with quantitive answers to the research question.
- If you received between **4&ndash;7 points** you came up with qualitative answers to the research question.
- If you received between **0&ndash;3 points** you came up with few or no answers at all to the research question.

## Part XXX: SWOT Analysis

Before I meet with a client, I personally like to review their current website, use the product or service and conduct a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWOT_analysis" target="_blank" title="SWOT Analysis">Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats</a> (SWOT) Analysis to get a wholistic understanding of the organization. _This includes their competition._ 

With the remaining class time you will conduct a SWOT Analysis of your proposed project. On paper, in a spread sheet, etc. answer the following questions. Do your best to answer these questions without thinking about potential visual design solutions. I‚Äôve pulled the following prompts from the <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_05.htm" target="_blank" title="Mindtools Website">Mindtools</a> website and they may not be answerable right now, so just skip those over. These are just prompts to put each category into context, so please add your own questions or answers!

Finally, you truly can not answer these questions until you know who your competition is and what is already out there. So find your competition first, then start the SWOT analysis.

#### Strengths

- What advantages does your organization have?
- What do you do better than anyone else?
- What unique or lowest-cost resources can you draw upon that others can‚Äôt?
- What do people in your market see as your strengths?
- What factors mean that you ‚Äúget the sale‚Äù?
- What is your organization's Unique Selling Proposition?

#### Weaknesses

- What could you improve?
- What should you avoid?
- What are people in your market likely to see as weaknesses?
- What factors lose you sales?

#### Opportunities

- What good opportunities can you spot?
- What interesting trends are you aware of?
- Opportunities can come from:
  - Changes in technology and markets on both a broad and narrow scale.
  - Changes in social patterns, population profiles, lifestyle changes, etc.
  - Local events.

#### Threats

- What obstacles do you face?
- **What are your competitors doing?**
- Are quality standards or specifications for your job, products or services changing?
- Is changing technology threatening your position?
- Do you have bad debt or cash-flow problems?
- Could any of your weaknesses seriously threaten your business?
